# 🎵 Blind Source Separation (BSS) for Instrument Separation

## 🎯 Overview
This repository contains implementations of **Blind Source Separation (BSS)** techniques for separating musical instruments from a mixed audio signal. We focus on two key methods:

- **Independent Component Analysis (ICA)**: Assumes instrument signals are statistically independent and works best with multiple microphone recordings.
- **Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)**: Decomposes a spectrogram into components representing different instrument sounds, which can be improved with supervised learning.
